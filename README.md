## Core Docs

- Product requirements: [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md)
- Architecture: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Progress: [docs/PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md)
- AI workflow: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- GitBook: [docs/gitbook/README.md](docs/gitbook/README.md)

## Workflow

```bash
bun install
bun harness:advance
bun harness:add-surface --type agent
bun harness:sync-docs
bun harness:audit
```

This workspace is monorepo-first. Keep adding new surfaces inside the same repository as later milestones.
Do not bootstrap product frameworks such as Next.js, Tauri, or provider SDK stacks during scaffold setup. Introduce them only inside milestone tasks.

- `apps/`: current surfaces -> web
- `packages/shared/`: shared contracts and utilities
- `packages/shared/api/`: agent-facing API wrappers
