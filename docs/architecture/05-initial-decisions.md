## 5. Initial Decisions

- Use Bun as the single package manager
- Use `.harness/*.ts` as the local runtime instead of relying on external skill paths
- Organize PRD, Architecture, Progress, and AI operating rules using thin entry points + module directories
- All generated files prioritize being executable, not merely described in documentation
- Preserve existing repo structure where it aligns with the Harness flow; rewrite only where the current structure blocks milestones or validation
- Initial detected scripts: build, check:deps, format, format:check, lint, test, typecheck
