## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to **security@clawmarket.dev**
2. **Subject line**: `[SECURITY] clawmarket — [Brief description]`
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

| Action | Timeframe |
|--------|-----------|
| **Acknowledge receipt** | Within 48 hours |
| **Initial assessment** | Within 1 week |
| **Status update** | Every 2 weeks until resolved |
| **Fix released** | Depends on severity (critical: ASAP, high: 2 weeks, medium: next release) |

We will coordinate with you on disclosure timing. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released.

## Security Best Practices

This project follows these security practices:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt/argon2)
- Authentication tokens have expiration times and are rotated regularly
- Authorization checks are enforced at the service layer, not just the UI

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS)
- API keys and secrets are stored in environment variables, never in code
- Database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection

### Input Validation
- All external inputs are validated and sanitized before processing
- Output is encoded to prevent XSS attacks
- File uploads are restricted by type and size

### Dependencies
- Dependencies are regularly audited for known vulnerabilities
- Automated dependency updates are enabled where possible
- Only well-maintained packages with active security response are used

### Infrastructure
- HTTPS is enforced for all endpoints
- Security headers are configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Logging captures security-relevant events without exposing sensitive data

## Scope

The following are considered in scope for security reports:

- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and other injection attacks
- Sensitive data exposure
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Insecure direct object references
- Remote code execution

The following are **out of scope**:

- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks
- Issues in third-party services or dependencies (report upstream)
- Issues requiring physical access to a device
