## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (latest stable version)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor with TypeScript support (VS Code recommended)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd clawmarket

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your local configuration

# Verify the setup
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun test
bun run build
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

All work must be done on a feature branch — developing directly on `main` is forbidden.

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New feature implementation | `feature/T001-user-auth` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/T015-login-redirect` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, refactoring, tooling | `chore/T020-update-deps` |

Branch names should include the Task ID when applicable: `[prefix]/T[ID]-[short-description]`

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from the current milestone branch (or `main` if no milestone is active)
2. **Implement** the changes following the project's architecture and coding conventions
3. **Test** your changes — all existing and new tests must pass
4. **Create a PR** using the pull request template
5. **Review** — address all review feedback before merge
6. **Merge** — squash merge or rebase merge (no merge commits)

### PR Requirements

- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] PR description clearly explains what and why
- [ ] Related Task ID is referenced
- [ ] No unrelated changes included

## Commit Message Conventions

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `style` | Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, tooling, dependency updates |

### Examples

```bash
feat(T001-auth): add email/password authentication

Implements sign-up and sign-in flows with bcrypt password hashing
and JWT token generation.

Task-ID: T001
Closes: PRD#F001
```

```bash
fix(T015-api): handle null response from external service

The payment gateway returns null instead of an error object
when the service is unavailable. Added null check and proper
error propagation.

Task-ID: T015
```

## Testing Requirements

- All tests must pass before submitting a PR: `bun test`
- Maintain or improve test coverage — do not reduce coverage
- Write tests for:
  - New features (unit + integration where applicable)
  - Bug fixes (regression test that reproduces the bug)
  - Edge cases and error paths

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun test --watch

# Run a specific test file
bun test src/services/auth.test.ts

# Run with coverage
bun test --coverage
```

---

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase — consistency is more important than personal preference
- Run the linter and formatter before committing:

```bash
# Check for lint errors
bun run lint

# Check formatting
bun run format:check

# Auto-fix formatting
bun run format
```

### Key Rules

- No `console.log` in committed code (use the project logger)
- No `: any` type annotations — use precise types
- No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` without a linked issue
- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or tokens
- Files must not exceed 400 lines
- Functions should be concise and single-purpose
